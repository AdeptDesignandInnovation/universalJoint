More information at https://discord.gg/P2Gb2VQdvm

this is A design for an universal joint for 20*20 mm extrusion

10 - 15 degrees of freedom in pitch, ya, and roll

infinite freedom axialy

using standard PTFE 2 * 4 "bowden tube"

not all of the arched tube slots are required. Add them symmetrically or reciprically top and bottom until the rotational axies feel good

all four straight tubes are required.

once one its rail ( piece of 2020 extrusion ) drive 2.5 mm grub screws into the straight tubes (contacting the extrusion) ONE AT A TIME until the axial movement no longer has play.

Do not add more grub screws than required to remove the "free play".

2.5 mm screws will expand the outer diameter of the tube slightly.

for now, best results come from leaving the arched tubes 3 - 6 mm longer than the channels so that they poke out the swivle body a little on each side.
